### Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to the attention mechanismâ€”a crucial concept in modern deep learning, especially in transformer models and large language models (LLMs). Through practical implementations and visualizations, this project walks through the building blocks of attention using PyTorch.

The attention mechanism is a foundational component in transformer architectures, which are at the heart of many state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and others. Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of an input sequence, enabling them to understand complex relationships between elements. In this project, we use PyTorch to implement and explore these attention mechanisms step by step.

### Prerequisites
